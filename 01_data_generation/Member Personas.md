# **Member Personas**
## *This project uses 7 distinct member personas based on real-world HVCU member behavior patterns.*

**Embedded Characteristics:**
- Balances  
- Transaction Counts 
- Product Counts 
- Product Type 
- Account Usage 

*Time Series Data:*
- Length of time between transactions
- Length of time between product usage
 
## **Persona Types:**
- Primary Banker: Direct deposit, high transaction count, multiple products → low churn risk (Primacy)
- Rate Shopper: Large balance in CD, minimal transactions → churns at CD maturity 
- Loan-Only: Just auto loan, pays off, then primary savings goes dormant → high churn risk post-payoff
- Slow Adopter: Opens account, takes 6 months to activate, eventually becomes engaged → risk early, stable later
- Emergency User: Uses PALs frequently, volatile balance, excessive privilege pay → moderate churn risk, needs intervention (Cross Sell)
